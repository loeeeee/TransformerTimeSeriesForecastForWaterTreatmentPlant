# Transformer for time series data forecasting

**No data included in the repo**. However, it should work fine with most csv data input.

I am considering include the data later when the repo is ready

## Usage

Three main things:

- preprocessing.py
- main_transformer_forecast.py
- main_transformer_classifier.py

The fnn is mainly for fun.

The rest of the code are mainly helper
